We all have done alot of discussion and then did our project (we have tried to distribute the work equally amoung us without any chaos),

The below given data is the details of our contribution:-

Patel Pishva - data collection and prepared the dataset (used kaggle),
Patel Adit - wrote the whole source code in python idle (also uploaded to GitHub),
Sejpalsinh Rayjada - collected the information on population growth through different platforms,
Dhwani Kharva - finalised the tools we have used and ensure the correct libararies used,


Looking forward for some more intresting projects like this  :>
