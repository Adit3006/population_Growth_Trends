##Tools & Libraries:Tools and Libraries Used in the Population
Growth Trends

1.Python

Python is the primary programing language used for
scripting,data analysis,and visulization.

2.Libraries

1) Pandas:
Purpose: Data manipulation and analysis.
Usage in the Script: Creating and managing a dataset
(Data Frame)
Installation: pip install pandas

4) Matplotlib:
Purpose: Data visulization.
Installation: pip install matplotlib

##Data Source:The current dataset used in the script is
synthetic data created for demonstration purpose.

##Summary of Population Growth Trend

1. Steady Growth:
   
○ The population has grown consistently,
increasing from approximately 5.5 billion in 1990
to over 8 billion in 2025.

○ This reflects an average annual growth of around
0.8% during this period.

3. Linear Trend:
   
○ The trend appears nearly linear, indicating a
steady rate of growth over the years.

5. Milestones:
   
○ The population crossed 6 billion around the year
2000 and 7 billion in the early 2010s.

○ It is projected to reach or slightly exceed 8 billion
by 2025.

7. Global Implications:
   
○ The increasing population poses challenges for
urban planning, resource management, and
environmental sustainability.

○ It highlights the need for policies focused on
sustainable development to balance growth with
ecological preservation
